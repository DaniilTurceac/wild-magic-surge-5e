# Wild Magic Surge 5e

This module adds a Chat message every time a player with the feat `Wild Magic Surge` casts a `level 1 spell` or higher.

I was getting fed up of having to remember whenever this occured so I created this small module to alert me.

You have an option to change the default message in the module settings page should you wish.

## Installation

To install, follow these instructions:

* Inside Foundry, select the Game Modules tab in the Configuration and Setup menu.
* Click the Install Module button and enter the following URL: `https://github.com/johnnolan/wild-magic-surge-5e/releases/latest/download/module.json`
* Click Install and wait for installation to complete.

Alternatively, use the integrated module manager in Foundry.

## Requirements

This module requires `betterrolls5e` and the `dnd5e` game system to work. Your character will also need to have a `Feat` set in their character called `Wild Magic Surge`.

I will look to remove dependencies in the future and make this more configurable as I level up in Foundry.

This module should prompt you on install if you don't have these dependencies installed.
